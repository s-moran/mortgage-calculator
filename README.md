# mortgage-calculator
Graphical interface using ipywidgets to calculate the evolution of principal and interest by varying interest rate, lump sum payment, compounding frequency, payment, and payment frequency. 

Useful for **variable rate** mortgages to determine what payment is needed to pay off principal over the amortization period provided that rates remain at their current level. If this is the case, use the 'term_start' variable to control when you actually started the loan so that the term and amortization period is correct.

Note: For full freedom in adjusting payment frequency, need to use daily (D) compounding frequency. Default is month-start (MS) payments with MS interest compounding.
